## List of the differences between E4E in VSCode and in Theia

### Compare feature

**Behaviour in VSCode**: https://ent.box.com/s/lgrh4uom1oi743p8xcvbitcy6fa96cbe

**Behaviour in Theia**: https://ent.box.com/s/p8v297t72lzmgod12s9pcnnmijov2pmn

**Workaround description**: in Theia, users should save the conflict resolution updates in the opened diff editor (CTRL+S/CMD+S) and open the Command Palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P/CMD+SHIFT+P), where they can use the commands: `Accept changes`, `Discard changes` to get the same behaviour, as in VSCode with the buttons.
